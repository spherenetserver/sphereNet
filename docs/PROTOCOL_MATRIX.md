# Sphere 56x Protocol Matrix

This matrix tracks incoming client opcodes that SphereNet currently routes through
`PacketManager`. It is intentionally focused on parser coverage: every registered
incoming handler below must be documented here, and tests fail if registry/docs drift.

## Mandatory Implemented

server. Variable-length packets with invalid lengths are rejected by `NetworkManager`.

Known incoming subcommands are centralized in `ExtendedCommandRegistry`.
