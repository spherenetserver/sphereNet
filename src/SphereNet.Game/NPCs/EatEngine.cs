/// Eating, for players and pets alike.

/// Source-X routes both through the same pair: Use_EatQty works out how much of the
/// stack is actually wanted (CCharUse.cpp:870) and EatAnim raises the stats and fires
/// the @Eat event (CCharAct.cpp:3436). SphereNet had two separate hand-written
/// versions - a player double-click that added a flat five and a pet feed that added
/// ten per unit - and the pet one fired no event at all, so a fed pet ran no script.
///
/// Three things follow from having one path:
///
///  * A stack is consumed by the NEEDED amount, not wholesale. The reference refuses
///    outright when there is no room left (:891) and otherwise takes only as many
///    units as the free space calls for (:894), which is why dropping a hundred rations
///    on a full pet no longer destroys them.
///  * @Eat gets the reference's arguments: ARGN1 is a STAT LIMIT starting at zero -
///    not the food restored - with LOCAL.Hits / Mana / Stam / Food carrying the gains
///    and the item as the object argument, all read back afterwards (:3456-3476).
///  * RETURN 1 skips the gains but does NOT save the food: Use_EatQty calls
///    ConsumeAmount after EatAnim returns either way (:913).
