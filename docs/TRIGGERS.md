# Script Trigger Reference

Every trigger SphereNet actually fires, with the script values available inside it.

## Argument model

When a trigger runs, the script body executes **on the object the trigger belongs to** (`this` / the implicit `i` context) and can read these variables:

| Variable | Source field | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `<src>` | `CharSrc ?? ItemSrc` | The actor that caused the trigger |
| `<argo>` | `Object1` (`O1`) | Primary related object |
| `<act>` | `Object2` (= `CharSrc ?? ItemSrc`) | Same as `<src>` in every wiring |
| `<argn>` / `<argn1>` | `Number1` (`N1`) | First number |
| `<argn2>` | `Number2` (`N2`) | Second number |
| `<argn3>` | `Number3` (`N3`) | Third number |
| `<args>` | `ArgString` (`S1`) | String argument |

`<act>` always equals `<src>`, so it is omitted from the tables below. "this" is the trigger's owning object. **RETURN 1** describes what cancelling the trigger does (blank = return value is ignored).

> Source of truth: `TriggerDispatcher.cs` (`WrapArgs`, name maps), `TriggerTypes.cs` (enums), and every `FireCharTrigger` / `FireItemTrigger` call site. Only triggers with a real fire site are listed; enum-only triggers are in the last section.

Notes:
- `@RegionEnter/Leave/Step` and `@Room*` do **not** set `<src>` (only `S1`); the region/room name is in `<args>`. The region's own EVENTS `@Enter/@Exit/@Step` blocks fire separately via `FireRegionEvents` with `<src>` set.
- Region EVENTS also receive two periodic triggers via `FireRegionEvents` (fired from the environment tick, ~6s, only while players are present): `@CliPeriodic` fires once per online player in the region (`<src>` = that player, `<args>` = region name); `@RegPeriodic` fires once per inhabited region per tick (`<src>` = a representative player in that region, `<args>` = region name). Uninhabited regions never tick. Mirrors Source-X `CSector` `iRegionPeriodic`.
- `@Death` on the reactive-armor path (attacker dies) has `<src>` = the target.
- `@NPCRestock` fires from two paths: spawn/finalize (`<src>` = the NPC) and opening a vendor (`<src>` = the player).

| `@AddObj` | Spawner object added | spawner item | added char | added char | – | – | ignored |
| `@DelObj` | Spawner object removed | spawner item | removed char | removed char | – | – | ignored |

Notes:
- `@TargOn_*`: `<argn1/2/3>` are the target point's x/y/z; `<args>` is the targeted graphic id (as a string).
- `@Damage` and `@Timer` do not set `CharSrc` (only `ItemSrc`), so `<src>`/`<act>` = the item itself.

## Cross-fired `item*` character triggers

When an item trigger fires, `TriggerDispatcher` also runs the matching `item<TrigName>` block (e.g. `@itemDClick`, `@itemEquip`, `@itemStep`) on the **`<src>` character** as a cross-target. These have no dedicated fire site — they are a by-product of the item trigger, letting a character script react to its items.

## Resource triggers

`@ResourceGather` / `@ResourceTest` fire on a `REGIONRESOURCE` definition via `FireResourceTrigger` (`GatheringEngine.cs`), not on a normal item. `<src>` = the gatherer; `@ResourceTest` provides N1=SkillMin, N2=SkillMax; `@ResourceGather` provides N1=reap amount.

---

## Defined but not fired

These exist in `TriggerTypes.cs` (and have name mappings) but have **no** literal `FireCharTrigger` / `FireItemTrigger` call site, so scripts hooking them will not run today. This list is locked by `TriggerCoverageGuardrailTests`, which recomputes it from the engine source on every run — wiring a backlog trigger (or adding a new enum value) fails that test until this list is updated.

> The `Char*` and `item*` mirror families (e.g. `CharAttack`, `itemDClick`) are **not** in this list: they are fired indirectly by name through the dispatcher cross-fire path (`"char" + name` / `"item" + name` in `TriggerDispatcher.cs`), so a script hooking them does run.

Each trigger carries a wiring priority by shard impact (P0 highest). The buckets are encoded in `TriggerCoverageGuardrailTests` and partition the backlog exactly.

**Character (24)**

- **P0 (3)** — all remaining are deferred (need infrastructure first): `HitIgnore`, `NPCSeeNewPlayer`, `NPCSeeWantItem`.
  - **Wired** (the rest of the original P0 set): `KarmaChange`, `FameChange`, `MurderMark` (`DeathEngine` + `Character.On*`); `SkillChange`, `StatChange` (`SkillEngine` gain hooks, runtime gain only); `CombatAdd`, `CombatDelete`, `CombatEnd` (`Character` attacker-list hooks); `NPCRefuseItem` (drop-on-NPC accept gate); `NPCSpecialAction` (breath/throw); `MurderDecay` (`Character` notoriety-decay hook); `NotoSend` (`ComputeNotoriety` via `Character.OnNotoSend`, installed only when the **IsTrigUsed gate** — `TriggerDispatcher.IsCharTriggerUsed` / `BuildUsedTriggerCache` — reports `@NotoSend` hooked, so the per-observer hot path stays a null check otherwise).
  - **Deferred — infrastructure first:** `HitIgnore` (no attacker "ignore" flag / NPC ignore-scan); `NPCSeeNewPlayer` (no per-NPC seen-player memory; `@NPCLookAtChar` already fires on every scan); `NPCSeeWantItem` (NPCs only scan corpses; no ground-item "want" logic). Skill/stat **decay** trigger coverage is also a follow-up.
- **P1 (7)** — moderate: PetDesert, ExpChange, ExpLevelChange, SkillUseQuick, Jail, CallGuards, EnvironChange. *(Wired since: `Eat`, `SkillMenu`, `SkillWait` (IsTrigUsed-gated), `Follow`, `PartyDisband`, `SpellSelect`, `SpellBook`, `PersonalSpace` (movement shove), `EffectAdd` (spell effect applied, IsTrigUsed-gated). Deferred: `SkillUseQuick` — `UseQuick` is atomic, pre-roll cancel needs a check/gain split; `Jail` — no central jail method; `CallGuards` — no "guards" keyword / guard-summon system; `PetDesert` — no pet loyalty/happiness meter, decay, or go-wild path; `ExpChange`/`ExpLevelChange` — no runtime experience/level system (`Exp`/`Level` are persistence-only fields); `EnvironChange` — needs per-character light/weather state to fire only on an actual change.)*
- **P2 (14)** — low: the `User*` modern-client buttons (UserBugReport, UserExWalkLimit, UserGlobalChatButton, UserKRToolbar, UserMailBag, UserQuestArrowClick, UserSpecialMove, UserUltimaStoreButton, UserVirtue), HouseDesignCommit, HouseDesignExit, ToolTip, Targon_Cancel, NPCLostTeleport.

**Item (20)** — all **P2** (no core gameplay gate today): SpellEffect, MemoryEquip, Redeed, RegionEnter, RegionLeave, ShipMove, ShipStop, ShipTurn, Smelt, Start, Stop, Level, Complete, AddRedCandle, AddWhiteCandle, DelRedCandle, DelWhiteCandle, PickupSelf, PickupStack, Tooltip. (`ResourceGather` / `ResourceTest` are fired via the resource path above, not as item triggers, so they are excluded.)
